    <h2>Decription</h2>
    <p>Since food for air travel needs to be prepared far in advance, airlines back in the day created a special cut of chicken breast that wouldn't dry out as much as normal.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken</li>
        <li>1 drizzle olive oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt to taste</li>
        <li>ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 pinches herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon canyenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 talblespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 talblespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken stock</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice off 1/2 of each chicken wing by cutting through the joint where the wing meets the drumette. Slice through the skin between the thighs and breasts. Make a shallow cut along the breast bone and 2 deep cuts on either side, separating the breasts.</li>
        <li>Slice each breast off the carcass using the tip of the knife, keeping the blade pressed against the bone. Cut through the cartilage to remove breast with the wing attached.</li>
        <li>Remove the tenders and trim as needed. Season with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, pepper, herbes de Provence, and cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>Push your finger gently under the skin of each breast, right next to the wing bone, to separate it from the meat. Slide 1 tender under the skin, center it, and smooth over the skin. Sprinkle salt over breasts.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts, skin-side down. Cook until bottom is browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Flip, reduce heat to medium, and cook until no longer pink on the inside, 7 to 10 minutes more. Add 1 tablespoon butter, rosemary, and thyme. Baste chicken with the butter. Remove chicken from the skillet.</li>
        <li>Pour stock into the pan; increase heat to high. Boil until reduced to desired thickness, about 2 minutes. Turn off heat and whisk in remaining butter. Slice each chicken breast into thirds and spoon the pan sauce on top.</li>
    </ol>
